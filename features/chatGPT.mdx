You can use the `chat` command to query AI chat models inside Wave terminal. 

Usage 
```
/chat tell me how to use the sed command
```

Out of the box, this command will send a request through our cloud servers.
If you'd prefer to query the OpenAI API directly, you can specify your own OpenAI key, as well as the model
that you would like to use in the settings. 

We also have support for changing the API base url if you want to use Azure models or other 3rd party API's. 
You can set the base url with the client:set command, like so:

```
/client:set openaibaseurl="<BASE URL>"
```
The API you specify must have the same endpoints and same protocol as the OpenAI API. 

In order to prevent abuse, you must have telemetry enabled to use the cloud servers. There is currently a rate limit of 200 requests per day.
