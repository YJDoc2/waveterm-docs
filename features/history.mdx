## Command History
To access standard command history, you can press UpArrow just like in your normal terminal. These commands are filtered to be from the current screen and the current remote.

But Wave keeps command history across all remotes, all tabs, and all sessions so you can easily recall a command you may have run in a separate tab or on a different machine to run. You enter history search using “Ctrl-R” or “Cmd-H”. From there you can still hit up or down arrow to navigate your history, but there are additional filters. You can toggle search to include all remotes, everything in your current session, or your global history.

> Wave keeps metadata for *all* commands that you run through it, including current working directory, status code, command duration, time, remote, etc.
