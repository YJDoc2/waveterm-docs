title: Using Wave Terminal with zsh
---

Wave Terminal currently only supports `bash`. Your environment (including variables, functions, and aliases) is read from the standard bash startup files (.bash_profile). In order to customize Wave's environment at startup Wave will set the environment variable `WAVESHELL`. If you are currently using `zsh`, you might have to transfer some of your `.zprofile` setup into your `.bash_profile have Wave pick up your path and other environment settings.  

> Note that supporting zsh is high on our technical roadmap and we expect to have have at least partial (if not full) zsh support in the next couple of months.

## How do I get brew commands to work?

If using brew, get brew commands to work by running the `brew shellenv` command in a Wave Terminal tab session. This will update the current tab session. To update all sessions in Wave Terminal, add the `shellenv` command to your .bashrc file. See below for further instructions.

## How do I get nvim to work in Wave Terminal?

Any applications installed with brew will likely need a PATH update, see the previous FAQ for further details on how to do this.
